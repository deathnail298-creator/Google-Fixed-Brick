# Executive / Contractor Appendix

## Scope and Intent

This appendix provides a minimal, high-level summary of estimated cost, schedule, and unit pricing associated with progressing beyond Phase 1. The values presented here are intentionally coarse and are not decomposed into subsystems, labor categories, or procurement details.

No additional technical claims are made in this appendix. The estimates are provided solely to support executive-level screening and contractor decision-making.

## Phase 1 to Commercialization — Estimated Cost

**Estimated Total Cost:** **$8–12 million USD**

This estimate represents an order-of-magnitude cost to progress from a completed Phase 1 prototype through engineering refinement, qualification, and preparation for initial commercial deployment of a fixed-brick unit.

## Phase 1 to Commercialization — Estimated Time

**Estimated Total Time:** **30–36 months**

This estimate represents elapsed calendar time from the conclusion of Phase 1 through readiness for initial commercial deployment, assuming uninterrupted funding and a conventional aerospace development cadence.

## Estimated Price per Fabricated Unit

**Estimated Unit Price:** **$250,000 USD per brick**

This estimate reflects a moderate-volume production scenario and includes fabrication, assembly, and standard verification activities. It does not assume mass production, aggressive cost optimization, or bespoke mission-specific customization.

## Boundary Conditions

The estimates above:

* Are provided without detailed breakdowns by design, manufacturing, or testing activities
* Do not include launch services, spacecraft integration, or mission operations
* Do not constitute a quote, offer, or commitment
* Are subject to revision under a separate commercial license agreement

**Plain-English Summary**

This appendix gives rough estimates for how much it could cost, how long it could take, and what each compute brick might cost to build after Phase 1. The numbers are intentionally broad and are meant only for early screening, not detailed planning or contracting. They do not imply readiness or a commitment to build.
