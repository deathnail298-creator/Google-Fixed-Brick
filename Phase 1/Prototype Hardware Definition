# Phase 1 — Prototype Hardware Definition

## Prototype Scope

The Phase 1 prototype is a single Google Fixed Brick representative unit intended to validate fixed-power behavior, predictable thermal output, and isolation principles under laboratory conditions. The prototype is not flight hardware and is not required to meet space-qualification standards.

The prototype must not introduce functionality that contradicts Phase 0 invariants, including dynamic power management, runtime configurability, or cross-unit coordination.

## Brick Definition (Phase 1)

The Phase 1 brick consists of:

* A compute payload capable of sustained batch computation
* A hardware-enforced fixed power cap that limits total brick power draw
* A minimal power input interface
* A minimal thermal interface suitable for coupling to a passive heat rejection element used in testing
* A minimal mechanical mounting arrangement for safe bench operation

No other interfaces are required.

## Fixed Power Enforcement

The prototype must implement power draw as a hard ceiling at the electrical level. Fixed power behavior must not rely on software throttling or workload selection alone.

Acceptable implementations for the Phase 1 prototype include:

* A fixed-current or fixed-power front-end power stage limiting input draw
* A dedicated power-limiting module that caps total brick consumption
* A supply architecture that physically cannot exceed a defined maximum draw

The objective is that, across tested workloads, the brick’s input power remains within a narrow band around a fixed setpoint or hard ceiling.

## Compute Payload Requirements

The compute payload must be sufficient to:

* Sustain continuous operation for thermal steady-state testing
* Run representative batch workloads that vary internal utilization
* Operate without requiring network services, orchestration, or external control beyond start/stop

No specific processor family, accelerator type, or software stack is required at Phase 1. Selection should favor availability, simplicity, and repeatability.

## Thermal Interface and Test Radiator

The brick must provide a defined thermal coupling surface or mount point to support a passive heat rejection element used during Phase 1 tests. This may be implemented as:

* A conduction plate or heat spreader
* A fixed thermal strap interface
* A direct mount to a passive radiator surrogate (e.g., finned heat sink)

Active cooling is excluded. Any use of forced convection in the laboratory must be treated as a test convenience only and must be explicitly documented as not representative of the intended passive rejection mechanism.

## Isolation Requirements

The prototype must be constructed such that:

* Electrical behavior is isolated to the single brick power input
* Thermal paths are limited to the dedicated thermal interface
* No dependency exists on other bricks or shared subsystems

Any external test instrumentation must not be required for normal brick operation.

## Prototype Deliverables

Phase 1 prototype deliverables include:

* One representative brick prototype meeting the above constraints
* A documented fixed power setpoint or cap value used for testing
* A documented thermal interface description suitable for repeatable mounting
* A minimal operating procedure covering startup, steady-state operation, and shutdown

**Plain-English Summary**

The Phase 1 prototype is a single compute brick that is physically prevented from drawing more than a fixed amount of power. It includes only what is necessary to run steady workloads and measure heat output through a simple passive thermal interface. The prototype avoids flight hardware requirements and excludes features like software-based throttling, coordination, or shared infrastructure.
